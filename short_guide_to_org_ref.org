* Report writing using org-ref
  label:ch:1
** Citing a paper
   In order to cite a paper, first one needs to save all the *bibtex*
   entries in a file, say *references.bib*. To have access in all the
   devises one can store that file in *dropbox* or *drive*.

   Then we can make org-ref to see this by writing the following line
   in *.emacs* file or *init.el* file.

   #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
     (setq reftex-default-bibliography '("~/Dropbox/Research/references.bib"))
   #+END_SRC

   Detail code is available at
   https://github.com/dineshadepu/code/blob/snapshot/common/emacs_setup/init.el.

   After setting up the background for references one needs to type
   *C-c ]*.  Which brings up all the references in the provided
   *reference.bib* file.

   Searching for a keyword will bring up the requisite paper(s), which can be
   selected and cited.

   cite:hoover-1994-molec-dynam

   At the bottom of the file specify the bibliography style, and bibiliography
   file name.

   #+NAME: example
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
       bibliography:./references.bib
       bibliographystyle:./authyr.bst
   #+END_EXAMPLE
*** Note
    1. For the following example, I used a reference bibtex file,
       placed locally at the folder, rather than placing it in the
       dropbox or some sync folder. The bibliography style used here
       is not *plain*, it is a specified style as in *authyr* file.
    2. If you want to use your own style, place such specific *<some>.bst* file
       in the root folder, and name it in the file.



** Selecting more papers
   Suppose we want to cite more papers at a single point, one has to
   select all the references using control-space i.e., *C-spc*, and
   navigating through the rows and selecting all the references,
   finally press *enter*.

   cite:hoover-1994-molec-dynam,hernquist-1993-some-caution,hernquist-1989-trees-unific,petschek-1993-cylin-smoot


** Changing a cite type.
   Suppose I want to change the cite type, till now we saw *cite:<some
   reference>*, now we want something like
   citeauthor:hoover-1994-molec-dynam i.e., citing with author name.
   which in general is *citeauthor:hoover-1994-molec-dynam*. This can
   be done by clicking *C-u ENTER*, then we get many types of cites,
   and we can choose any one of them.





* Labelling chapters, equations, figures etc..
** Label a chapter, section, subsection
   In order to label a chapter we can use the function


   #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
     org-ref-helm-insert-label-link
   #+END_SRC

   # <<equation:pcisph>>
   \begin{equation}
   \label{equation:pcisph}%
   E = mc^{2}
   \end{equation}


   ref:equation:pcisph
   By invoking mini buffer using *M-x*, and typing the function.  To
   avoid frequent typing of such function, we can use leader key to
   bind to a specific key.
  - To cite a section or figure or a table, first give it a label.
    Here I am plotting a $sin$ curve using python.

    #+CAPTION: sin vs x in python label:fig:sin
    #+ATTR_LaTeX: scale=0.75
    [[./sin.png]]

   nameref:lisp
** Label figure and equation
   To label a equation, we can use the org mode equation formal,
   in the second line we can add the label link as following.


   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
       \begin{equation}
         \label{equation:pcisph}%
         E = mc^{2}
       \end{equation}
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   But figure is labelled in a different way. Either we can use latex
   to insert a figure and label it inside its source blocks or explicitly
   use org functionality.

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
       #+CAPTION: this is a figure label:fig:figure
       #+ATTR_LaTeX: scale=0.75
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   - Always try to use $label:fig:some$ functionality. Which will
     simply inserts labels in the document, which helps us to cite the
     line number page number and everything.

* Referring a label
  label:ch3
  To refer a label, type *C-u C-c ]*, which pops a mini buffer with all the
  available labels to refer. To change a referred label name, use *C-u Ret*
  while selecting such a label, to change the refer type.
